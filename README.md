## <a name="installation">Installation</a>

Upload the ```fever``` folder in the ```plugins``` folder of your TinyTinyRSS installation. Enable the plugin in the preferences and set your password for the Fever API.

See [here](http://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1981) for more detailed informations.

## <a name="debug">Debugging</a>

In the file ```fever_api.php``` there are two flags for debugging at the beginning of the file.

* ```DEBUG``` - set this to true to get a fever_debug.txt file in your root folder of the Tiny Tiny RSS installation.
* ```DEBUG_USER``` - set this to the id (from ttrss_users) of your user you would like to always authenticate on your Tiny Tiny RSS installation. The authentication process is then skipped and the api gets always authentication.
* ```DEBUG_FILE``` - set this to a filename that suits you for debugging this plugin if you need to.

## <a name="error">Error reporting</a>

If you got problems with authentication after updating the plugin, try to reenter the password in TinyTinyRSS Fever plugin and save it again.

When you find an error you may post it in the plugin [thread](http://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1981) or here on github.com in the [Issues](https://github.com/dasmurphy/tinytinyrss-fever-plugin/issues/) section.

Please include your debug log which should be cleaned up. Please remove your username, password and apikey before posting it.
